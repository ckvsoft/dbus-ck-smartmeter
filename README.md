# dbus-ck-smartmeter
Integrate ckvsoft smart meter into [Victron Energies Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus)

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the ckvsoft smartmeter to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.
Idea is pasend on @RalfZim project linked below.



## Inspiration
This project is my first on GitHub and with the Victron Venus OS, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:
- https://github.com/RalfZim/venus.dbus-fronius-smartmeter
- https://github.com/victronenergy/dbus-smappee
- https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery
- https://community.victronenergy.com/idea/114716/power-meter-lib-for-modbus-rtu-based-meters-from-a.html - [Old Thread](https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/85564/eastron-sdm630-modbus-energy-meter-community-editi.html)

## How it works
### My setup
- CkvSoft SmartMeter
  - 3-Phase installation
  - Connected to Wifi network "A"
  - IP 192.168.2.13/24  
- Victron Energy Multiplus 2 and Raspberry with Venus OS
  - 16Kwh LifePo4, Fronius PV
  - Connected to Wifi network "A"
  - IP 192.168.2.20/24

### Details / Process
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @RalfZim fronius smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.grid.http_40` or `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.http_40`
- After successful DBus connection Ckvsoft SmartMeter is accessed via REST-API - simply the /JsonData is called and a JSON is returned with all details
  A sample JSON file can be found [here](docs/shelly3em-status-sample.json)
- MAC is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls SmartMeter data every 750ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to `/data/dbus-smartmeter`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
wget https://github.com/ckvsoft/dbus-ck-smartmeter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-smartmeter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-smartmeter-main /data/dbus-smartmeter
chmod a+x /data/dbus-smartmeter/install.sh
/data/dbus-smartmeter/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file

### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-smartmeter/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the host in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | AccessType | Fixed value 'OnPremise' |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| DEFAULT  | CustomName  | Name of your device - usefull if you want to run multiple versions of the script |
| DEFAULT  | DeviceInstance  | DeviceInstanceNumber e.g. 40 |
| DEFAULT  | Role | use 'GRID' or 'PVINVERTER' to set the type of the SmartMeter |
| DEFAULT  | Position | Available Postions: 0 = AC, 1 = AC-Out 1, AC-Out 2 |
| DEFAULT  | LogLevel  | Define the level of logging - lookup: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels |
| ONPREMISE  | Host | IP or hostname of on-premise Ckvsoft SmartMeter web-interface |
